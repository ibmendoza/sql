<h3>Fetching Data from the Database</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at an example of how to query the database, working with
results. We&rsquo;ll query the <code>users</code> table for a user whose <code>id</code> is 1, and print out
the user&rsquo;s <code>id</code> and <code>name</code>.  We will assign results to variables, a row at a
time, with <code>rows.Scan()</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">var (
    id int
    name string
)
rows, err := db.Query(&quot;select id, name from users where id = ?&quot;, 1)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer rows.Close()
for rows.Next() {
    err := rows.Scan(&amp;id, &amp;name)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    log.Println(id, name)
}
err = rows.Err()
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening in the above code:</p>

<ol>
<li>We&rsquo;re using <code>db.Query()</code> to send the query to the database. We check the error, as usual.</li>
<li>We defer <code>rows.Close()</code>. This is very important.</li>
<li>We iterate over the rows with <code>rows.Next()</code>.</li>
<li>We read the columns in each row into variables with <code>rows.Scan()</code>.</li>
<li>We check for errors after we&rsquo;re done iterating over the rows.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is pretty much the only way to do it in Go. You can&rsquo;t
get a row as a map, for example. That&rsquo;s because everything is strongly typed.
You need to create variables of the correct type and pass pointers to them, as
shown.</p>

<p>A couple parts of this are easy to get wrong, and can have bad consequences.</p>

<ul>
<li>You should always check for an error at the end of the <code>for rows.Next()</code>
loop. If there&rsquo;s an error during the loop, you need to know about it. Don&rsquo;t
just assume that the loop iterates until you&rsquo;ve processed all the rows.</li>
<li>Second, as long as there&rsquo;s an open result set (represented by <code>rows</code>), the
underlying connection is busy and can&rsquo;t be used for any other query. That
means it&rsquo;s not available in the connection pool. If you iterate over all of
the rows with <code>rows.Next()</code>, eventually you&rsquo;ll read the last row, and
<code>rows.Next()</code> will encounter an internal EOF error and call <code>rows.Close()</code> for
you. But if for some reason you exit that loop -- an early return, or so on --
then the <code>rows</code> doesn&rsquo;t get closed, and the connection remains open. (It is
auto-closed if <code>rows.Next()</code> returns false due to an error, though). This is
an easy way to run out of resources.</li>
<li><code>rows.Close()</code> is a harmless no-op if it&rsquo;s already closed, so you can call
it multiple times. Notice, however, that we check the error first, and only
call <code>rows.Close()</code> if there isn&rsquo;t an error, in order to avoid a runtime panic.</li>
<li>You should <strong>always <code>defer rows.Close()</code></strong>, even if you also call <code>rows.Close()</code>
explicitly at the end of the loop, which isn&rsquo;t a bad idea.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t <code>defer</code> within a loop. A deferred statement doesn&rsquo;t get executed until
the function exits, so a long-running function shouldn&rsquo;t use it. If you do,
you will slowly accumulate memory. If you are repeatedly querying and
consuming result sets within a loop, you should explicitly call <code>rows.Close()</code>
when you&rsquo;re done with each result, and not use <code>defer</code>.</li>
</ul>
