<h3>Importing a Database Driver</h3>

<p>To use <code>database/sql</code> you&rsquo;ll need the package itself, as well as a driver for
the specific database you want to use.</p>

<p>You generally shouldn&rsquo;t use driver packages directly, although some drivers
encourage you to do so. (In our opinion, it&rsquo;s usually a bad idea.) Instead, your
code should only refer to types defined in <code>database/sql</code>, if possible. This
helps avoid making your code dependent on the driver, so that you can change the
underlying driver (and thus the database you&rsquo;re accessing) with minimal code
changes. It also forces you to use the Go idioms instead of ad-hoc idioms that a
particular driver author may have provided.</p>

<p>In this documentation, we&rsquo;ll use the excellent <a href="https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql">MySQL
drivers</a> from @julienschmidt and @arnehormann
 for examples.</p>

<p>Add the following to the top of your Go source file:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">import (
    &quot;database/sql&quot;
    _ &quot;github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql&quot;
)
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that we&rsquo;re loading the driver anonymously, aliasing its package qualifier
to <code>_</code> so none of its exported names are visible to our code. Under the hood,
the driver registers itself as being available to the <code>database/sql</code> package,
but in general nothing else happens.</p>

<p>Now you&rsquo;re ready to access a database.</p>
