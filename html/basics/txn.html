<h3>Working with Transactions</h3>

<p>In Go, a transaction is essentially an object that reserves a connection to the
datastore. It lets you do all of the operations we&rsquo;ve seen thus far, but
guarantees that they&rsquo;ll be executed on the same connection.</p>

<p>You begin a transaction with a call to <code>db.Begin()</code>, and close it with a
<code>Commit()</code> or <code>Rollback()</code> method on the resulting <code>Tx</code> variable. Under the
covers, the <code>Tx</code> gets a connection from the pool, and reserves it for use only
with that transaction. The methods on the <code>Tx</code> map one-for-one to methods you
can call on the database itself, such as <code>Query()</code> and so forth.</p>

<p>Prepared statements that are created in a transaction are bound exclusively to
that transaction. See <a href="prepared.html">prepared statements</a> for more.</p>

<p>You should not mingle the use of transaction-related functions such as <code>Begin()</code>
and <code>Commit()</code> with SQL statements such as <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>COMMIT</code> in your SQL
code. Bad things might result:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>Tx</code> objects could remain open, reserving a connection from the pool and not returning it.</li>
<li>The state of the database could get out of sync with the state of the Go variables representing it.</li>
<li>You could believe you&rsquo;re executing queries on a single connection, inside of a transaction, when in reality Go has created several connections for you invisibly and some statements aren&rsquo;t part of the transaction.</li>
</ul>

<p>While you are working inside a transaction you should be careful not to make
calls to the <code>Db</code> variable. Make all of your calls to the <code>Tx</code> variable that you
created with <code>db.Begin()</code>. The <code>Db</code> is not in a transaction, only the <code>Tx</code> is.
If you make further calls to <code>db.Exec()</code> or similar, those will happen outside
the scope of your transaction, on other connections.</p>

<p>If you need to work with multiple statements that modify connection state, you
need a <code>Tx</code> even if you don&rsquo;t want a transaction per se. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Creating temporary tables, which are only visible to one connection.</li>
<li>Setting variables, such as MySQL&rsquo;s <code>SET @var := somevalue</code> syntax.</li>
<li>Changing connection options, such as character sets or timeouts.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need to do any of these things, you need to bind your activity to a
single connection, and the only way to do that in Go is to use a <code>Tx</code>.</p>
