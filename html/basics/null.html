<h3>Working with NULL</h3>

<p>Nullable columns are annoying and lead to a lot of ugly code. If you can, avoid
them. If not, then you&rsquo;ll need to use special types from the <code>database/sql</code>
package to handle them, or define your own.</p>

<p>There are types for nullable booleans, strings, integers, and floats. Here&rsquo;s how
you use them:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">for rows.Next() {
    var s sql.NullString
    err := rows.Scan(&amp;amp;s)
    // check err
    if s.Valid {
       // use s.String
    } else {
       // NULL value
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Limitations of the nullable types, and reasons to avoid nullable columns in case
you need more convincing:</p>

<ol>
<li>There&rsquo;s no <code>sql.NullUint64</code> or <code>sql.NullYourFavoriteType</code>. You&rsquo;d need to
define your own for this.</li>
<li>Nullability can be tricky, and not future-proof. If you think something won&rsquo;t
be null, but you&rsquo;re wrong, your program will crash, perhaps rarely enough
that you won&rsquo;t catch errors before you ship them.</li>
<li>One of the nice things about Go is having a useful default zero-value for
every variable. This isn&rsquo;t the way nullable things work.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you need to define your own types to handle NULLs, you can copy the design of
<code>sql.NullString</code> to achieve that.</p>
